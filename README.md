# Assignment-8---Pentesting-Live-Targets
Codepath week 8

Time spent: ~3 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL INJECTION
-An attacker is able to inject SQL via the find a salesperson page. In the url where the ?id=# is, you are able to input SQL as opposed to an actual user id. The example code given in the instructions is ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--' which upon loading takes an additional 5 seconds.


Vulnerability #2: SESSION HIJACKING
-An attacker is able to change the session ID using public/hacktools/change_session_id.php provided in the instructions. After chaning the session ID, the attacker is then able to access the session of a legitimate user. 

## Green

Vulnerability #1: XSS
-An attacker is able to supply XSS script into the feedback section of the contact tab. When an authorized user goes to read the feedback, the XSS runs. 

Vulnerability #2: USER ENUMERATION
-Anyone attempting to log in can notice if they supply a legitimate username, the error is in bold. If the user enters an incorrect username, the error is non-bold. 


## Red

Vulnerability #1: CSRF
-An attacker is able to link a webpage in the feedback section. When a legitimate user accesses the url, the attacker gains access to the legitimate user's account and is able to edit their credentials. 

Vulnerability #2: IDOR
-Anyone is able view any legitimate user in the system even those not supposed to be viewable. To do this, an attacker would go to the find a salesperson tab, click on a salesperson, and change the ?id=# to a different number.

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

-Very ambiguous as to what was expected for this week as far as submission goes.
